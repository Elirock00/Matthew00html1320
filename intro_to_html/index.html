    <h2>A Little Bit About Myself</h2>
    <p>My name is Elijah Holden, and I am twenty-two years old. I am originally from Knoxville, but Chattanooga has grown on me immensley. I am a suit tailor on my off time and I also work for the Chattanooga Lookouts Baseball Organization as a video production team member. A few of my hobbies are playing golf, photography and hiking. I work for Giorgio Men's Wear as a suit tailor. I also do a lot of the graphic design work for the company. My experience in graphic design includes: banners for bridal shows, bus ads, billboard designs and many pamphlet designs for different events. </p>
